# My Python Scripts

Some do a little, some do a lot. Most scripts are documented with comments and
docstrings, and many depend on my [teacher-helper](https://github.com/jdevries3133/teacher-helper)
library.

## Dependencies

Since different scripts do different things, there are a lot of dependencies,
and there might be some scripts that use few or none.
